                        We started Lockdown last week. What this means is that we focus on
                        full test passes, fixing bugs, and meeting our Escrow entrance criteria.
                        The bug bar begins to go up over the next 6 weeks, details are

                            Three out of five isn't bad, but it's not good enough.
                            The key thing you can do is drive on bugs: find them, report them, fix them,
                            test the fixes. Selfhosting is a GREAT way to do these things.

                            For the bugfix RIs, we are taking two virtual build labs (vbls) at the same time after they have passed both Build Verification Tests (BVTs) and the relevant set of quality gates. The schedule is here.
                            Getting an IDW on the code complete build ("M9") is important so we can provide that build to our development partners for them to make progress on drivers and other deliverables. IDW defines the level of quality they can expect from the build. In addition, groups outside Windows but internal to MS standardize on IDW builds for testing and development.

Please work with your Legal and Corporate Affairs (LCA) contact - the goal is to have all patent claims filed by the end of July.

Implementation plans will be finalized over the next 2 weeks with the goal of having a pseudo-loc build available in June. (Note that Beta 1 is English-only.)

                        Last week a large number of Prefix bugs were filed against Beta 2, which skews the graph. While those bugs don’t block Beta 1, they must be fixed prior to any Beta 2 feature merge. To see how your team is doing, check out the daily updated graphs here, or the more detailed data here.

                        Now that we are entering lockdown,
                        this is the right time for me to hand over project status to SvenH.
                        Sven has been running the Longhorn project and ship room since the beginning of M9,
                        and taking on more and more responsibilities over that time. Beginning next week,
                        you’ll get mail from him rather than me (early notice on fixing up your inbox rules J).
                        He has a whole new set of jokes for you to get sick of, with 50% fewer references to Monty Python and Australia.
                        On a personal note, I’ve been writing these since XP was in development, and I just wanted to say Thank You!
                        to all of you who have offered support, encouragement, and feedback (as well as serving as a captive audience for my attempted humor)
                        over the past 4+ years. It’s been a privilege and an honor to have the opportunity to "speak" to each of you every week or so
                        about the project(s). <LineBreak />
                        Thanks, <LineBreak />
