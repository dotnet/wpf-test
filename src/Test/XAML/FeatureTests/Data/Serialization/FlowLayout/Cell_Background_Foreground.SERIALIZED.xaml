            <Paragraph>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore- While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door " 'T is some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door- Only this and nothing more."</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour. Nothing farther then he uttered-not a feather then he fluttered- Till I scarcely more than muttered, "Other friends have flown before- On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before." Then the bird said, "Nevermore."</Paragraph>
