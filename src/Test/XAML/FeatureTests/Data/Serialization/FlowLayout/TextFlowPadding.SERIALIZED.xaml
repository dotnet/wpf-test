        <Paragraph>Raincoast Books, the Canadian publisher of the Harry Potter series, is in full damage-control mode after a B.C. store prematurely sold up to 15 copies of the latest book last week.</Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>Raincoast heard about the gaffe on Friday, the day after the books were sold at the Real Canadian Superstore in Coquitlam – more than a week before the July 16 official release.</Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>On Saturday, the B.C. Supreme Court granted Raincoast a court injunction to help get the books back, and keep a lid on the plot. <FlowDocumentScrollViewer><FlowDocument><List><ListItem><Paragraph>LINK: <Hyperlink>Raincoast Books announcement</Hyperlink></Paragraph></ListItem></List></FlowDocument></FlowDocumentScrollViewer></Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>Company spokesperson Jamie Broadhurst says some of the purchasers have voluntarily returned their copies. And he says the company is offering a reward to get the others returned.</Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>"We're asking them to contact us and to temporarily return their copies of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince to us," he says.</Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>"And in exchange, what we will do, is on July 16 at one minute past midnight, we will return their copies to them along with a signed autographed bookplate to be affixed in their book from J.K. Rowling, and some gift items as well."</Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>The injunction also bars anyone from leaking the plot of the latest Harry Potter book before 12:01 a.m. this Saturday.</Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>The injunction exempts the book's official public relations campaign.</Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>This latest incident is similar to one in 2003 when a Wal-Mart in Quebec accidentally sold a few copies of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix before the release date.</Paragraph>
