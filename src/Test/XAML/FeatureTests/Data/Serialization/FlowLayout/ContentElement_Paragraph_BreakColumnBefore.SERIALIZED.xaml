  <Paragraph>BOSTON -- Gary Payton was back in Celtics green Friday night, one week after Boston shipped him off to Atlanta in a trade for Antoine Walker. Payton, who re-signed with Boston on Friday after being waived by the Hawks, said he chose the Celtics over Sacramento and Phoenix. "I thought Boston was the better fit," Payton said before the Celtics faced Charlotte on Friday night. "With the young guys, I thought I was obligated to come back to them and teach them some more," he said.</Paragraph>
