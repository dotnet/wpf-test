    <Paragraph TextIndent="20" Style="{DynamicResource ContentParagraph}">The alligator lizard may have been named for its likeness to a miniature alligator, but its habitat and size bear no resemblance. It is Canada's largest lizard and can attain a total length of 22 cm. It lives in dry, often rocky, wooded or partly wooded areas, and sometimes in grasslands in southern mainland British Columbia and Vancouver Island.</Paragraph>
    <Paragraph TextIndent="20" Style="{DynamicResource ContentParagraph}">Most characteristic is its prominent longitudinal fold of small, granular scales along each side. These contrast with the relatively large scales on the back and belly and allow for the expansion of the sides when the animal is breathing, feeding, or carrying young. It is wary in the open and usually found under cover of bark, logs, or stones. Insects and spiders are its main prey.</Paragraph>

    <Paragraph TextIndent="20" Style="{DynamicResource ContentParagraph}">This reptile of the coastal marshes and inland waters of the southeastern United States is considered an endangered species. Relentless hunting for hides reduced the numbers drastically in the 1960s until state and federal laws provided for complete legal protection. In addition, there are now import and export restrictions controlling trade in alligators and their skins.</Paragraph>

    <Paragraph TextIndent="20" Style="{DynamicResource ContentParagraph}">Anacondas are related to boa constrictors and pythons. None is venomous. They are constrictors; they suffocate their prey by coiling around it and squeezing.</Paragraph>
    <Paragraph TextIndent="20" Style="{DynamicResource ContentParagraph}">With a rumoured maximum weight of about 200 kg (441 lb.), the green anaconda is the most massive of the giant snakes. The body is dark green in colour (hence the name green anaconda) with large black dorsal spots and small lateral spots with lighter yellow centres. Adults can grow to more than 9 m (29.5 ft.) in length. The reticulated python is, on average, usually longer than the average anaconda, but because the green anaconda is much heavier than the other large constrictors, if you consider both length and weight, it is the largest snake in the world.</Paragraph>
    <Paragraph TextIndent="20" Style="{DynamicResource ContentParagraph}">The green anaconda occurs in South America, in the Amazon and Orinoco rivers system, and as far south as Bolivia. It is also found in Trinidad. Anacondas are tied very closely to water, and they are excellent swimmers and divers.</Paragraph>

    <Paragraph TextIndent="20" Style="{DynamicResource ContentParagraph}">Although the smallest of the sea turtles occurs from Nova Scotia to Mexico and across to Europe, its only nesting beaches are on the Gulf of Mexico, mainly just north of Tampico. There, in 1947, as many as 40,000 nesting females crowded the beach in a single day. Despite legal protection and military patrols of the beach at nesting times, these numbers have dwindled to sometimes only a few hundred.</Paragraph>
    <Paragraph TextIndent="20" Style="{DynamicResource ContentParagraph}">Nest robbing, and capturing females for food and leather caused much of the decline, and many Atlantic Ridley turtles have been accidentally drowned in shrimp trawls. Protective enclosures for egg-hatching and attempts to establish nesting beaches in Texas may help the Atlantic Ridley survive.</Paragraph>

    <Paragraph TextIndent="20" Style="{DynamicResource ContentParagraph}">The black rat snake may be the largest Canadian snake. Its maximum recorded length is 2.5 m, and individuals over 1.5 m are not uncommon. It feeds largely on mice, rats, and some birds, and it can quickly suffocate its prey by constricting it within the tight coils of its body. An excellent and frequent climber, it generally inhabits uplands away from water. It is most commonly seen in the rocky, largely non-agricultural, terrain of the Rideau Lakes region in eastern Ontario.</Paragraph>

    <Paragraph TextIndent="20" Style="{DynamicResource ContentParagraph}">The boa constrictor is a non-poisonous tropical snake belonging to a specialized group of reptiles -- the first vertebrate class completely independent of water. It is found in Central and South America and often reaches lengths of up to 4 m (13 ft.). It belongs to the same family as the python and anaconda, which reach lengths of up to 9 or 10m. The boa constrictor's life span is about 25 to 30 years. Some boas live in underground holes while others live in trees.</Paragraph>
    <Paragraph TextIndent="20" Style="{DynamicResource ContentParagraph}">Their prey consists mainly of birds and small mammals such as rats and agoutis. Boas seize their prey in their jaws, then entwine it in their powerful body coils and kill it by suffocation. Boas still have vestiges of a pair of hind limbs. They are one of the most beautifully coloured reptiles.</Paragraph>
    <Paragraph TextIndent="20" Style="{DynamicResource ContentParagraph}">This species is hunted for the skin trade, and products made from boa skin are common in souvenir shops. The boa constrictor is nominally protected by the Appendices to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), with the intention of controlling international trade.</Paragraph>

    <Paragraph TextIndent="20" Style="{DynamicResource ContentParagraph}">The common garter snake occurs in Canada from Prince Edward Island to British Columbia in a wide variety of colour patterns. The specimen shown here is from eastern Ontario and is black with lemon yellow stripes. Garter snakes are usually about 60 to 80 cm in length with the rare individual growing to over 135 cm.</Paragraph>
    <Paragraph TextIndent="20" Style="{DynamicResource ContentParagraph}">They feed upon earthworms, frogs, fish, and occasionally mice. In winter, they often den up in cracks or fissures in the earth beneath the frostline, sometimes by the thousands. The young are born live, usually 20 to 40 in a litter, with the maximum number recorded being 98. The flickering tongue is actually a sensory apparatus used to detect odours.</Paragraph>

    <Paragraph TextIndent="20" Style="{DynamicResource ContentParagraph}">Survivors of the dinosaur age, crocodiles are found in the warmer waters of Africa, Asia, Australia, and America. Crocodiles are often confused with alligators, but you can tell them apart by the shape of their tapered snout, and by the way crocodiles' lower teeth stick out when their jaws are closed.</Paragraph>
    <Paragraph TextIndent="20" Style="{DynamicResource ContentParagraph}">Crocodiles vary in size. The saltwater crocodile measures up to 10 m in length, while others are no more than 1 m long. Hunted extensively for their skins, large crocodiles are becoming increasingly rare. They eat fish, birds, and mammals, including the occasional human. Crocodiles are cold-blooded. They like basking in the sun, in groups, with their mouths open.</Paragraph>
    <Paragraph TextIndent="20" Style="{DynamicResource ContentParagraph}">These groups usually consist of individuals who are the same size because crocodiles are cannibalistic, and large crocodiles will eat smaller ones. In contrast, crocodile birds (Pluvianus Aegypticus) wander freely among the basking creatures, picking leeches and parasites from their skins, and food fragments from their mouths.</Paragraph>

It rarely exceeds 75 cm in length. A pair of enlarged teeth at the front of its mouth are hollow and resemble short, curved hypodermic needles. Through these teeth, poison may be injected.</Paragraph>
    <Paragraph TextIndent="20" Style="{DynamicResource ContentParagraph}">Because this poison may be toxic enough to kill an adult, antivenin is on hand at hospitals within its southwestern Ontario range. The massasauga occurs from the Niagara Peninsula north to Georgian Bay and east to the Muskoka Lakes. They frequent low swampy areas and feed largely on frogs and mice.</Paragraph>

    <Paragraph TextIndent="20" Style="{DynamicResource ContentParagraph}">Racers are nervous, quick-moving, snakes of open, bushy, or light-wooded areas who prey mainly on small rodents, frogs, lizards, and insects. Their scientific name was mistaken, for they never constrict. They do, however, sometimes use a loop of their body to hold their prey down before swallowing it.</Paragraph>
    <Paragraph TextIndent="20" Style="{DynamicResource ContentParagraph}">Three varieties occur in Canada. All are uniformly coloured above when adults but have a pattern of dark blotches when newly hatched.</Paragraph>

Large females may attain a shell length of 43 cm.</Paragraph>
    <Paragraph TextIndent="20" Style="{DynamicResource ContentParagraph}">In Canada, softshells have been found in southern Ontario and southwestern Quebec, in Lake Erie, and in the Ottawa, St. Lawrence, and Richelieu Rivers.

    <Paragraph TextIndent="20" Style="{DynamicResource ContentParagraph}">This is one of the rarest crocodile species in Asia. It has become very depleted throughout its range, which includes all major rivers and waterways of northern India and Burma. Although officially protected, it has declined rapidly due to a trade in skins and incidental killing by fishermen. Increased river traffic and agriculture have also had an adverse effect.</Paragraph>
    <Paragraph TextIndent="20" Style="{DynamicResource ContentParagraph}">Their future depends on strict law enforcement and observance of existing controls restricting trade in skins. Another possibility is the establishment of captive breeding stock under nearly natural conditions. There are few specimens in captivity, but most of the conditions have not been favourable for breeding.</Paragraph>

    <Paragraph TextIndent="20" Style="{DynamicResource ContentParagraph}">Female green turtles return to the same beaches regularly and in great numbers to lay their eggs. Throughout history these turtles have been an important source of food to local human populations and sea voyagers. The green turtle was once common in the warm oceans of the world, but has become increasingly scarce in areas where it is commercially exploited. It is still common, however, in Hawaii, but now rarely nests in North America, although feeding areas in Florida still have fairly large populations. The green turtle can also be found around Australia.</Paragraph>

Brazil, Costa Rica, Malaya, the Philippines, and Indonesia maintain protected hatcheries and regulate the harvest of the species.</Paragraph>
    <Paragraph TextIndent="20" Style="{DynamicResource ContentParagraph}">Although 58 countries have helped to protect the green turtle by joining an international convention controlling the import, export, and use of endangered species, the demand for turtle soup, "turtle oil" for cosmetics, and turtle skin for shoe leather has encouraged a continuing, and often illegal, trade.</Paragraph>

It suffers no adverse affects from eating cactus spines which pass easily through its digestive system. Favorite foods include leaves, buds, fruit, and cactus pads</Paragraph>
    <Paragraph TextIndent="20" Style="{DynamicResource ContentParagraph}">This lizard averages 1.2 m in length. It is yellowish with brown blotches on its sides and legs, and has a spiny crest running dorsally from its head. When Darwin visited the Galapagos Islands in 1835, he found so many land iguana burrows that he had to tread cautiously. Today, very few iguanas exist, and their future looks bleak. Humans have introduced a variety of domestic animals to the islands, including goats, which have eaten the protective undercoat of vegetation, thereby exposing young lizards to birds of prey.</Paragraph>

Unlike other turtles, the leatherback has no visible shell; instead, it has a carapace made up of hundreds of irregular bony plates, covered with a leathery skin. This rare sea turtle lives in warm sea waters and is known to breed off the West Indies, Florida, the northeastern coasts of South America, Senegal, Natal, Madagascar, Sri Lanka, and Malaysia.</Paragraph>
    <Paragraph TextIndent="20" Style="{DynamicResource ContentParagraph}">Occasionally it has been found swimming in cooler waters such as the Gulf of St. Lawrence, possibly carried by adverse winds or currents.
