      <Paragraph>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore- While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door " 'T is some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door- Only this and nothing more."</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December; And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. Eagerly I wished the morrow;-vainly I had sought to borrow From my books surcease of sorrow-sorrow for the lost Lenore- For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore- Nameless here for evermore.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Then the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain Thrilled me-filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before; So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating, " 'T is some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door- Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;- This it is and nothing more."</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer, "Sir," said I, "or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore; But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping, And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door, That I scarce was sure I heard you"-here I opened wide the door;- Darkness there and nothing more."</Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing, Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before; But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token, And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, "Lenore?" This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, "Lenore!" Merely this and nothing more.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning, Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before. "Surely," said I, "surely that is something at my window lattice; Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore- Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;- 'T is the wind and nothing more!"</Paragraph>
